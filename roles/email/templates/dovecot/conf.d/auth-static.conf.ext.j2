# Static passdb. Included from auth.conf.

# This can be used for situations where Dovecot doesn't need to verify the
# username or the password, or if there is a single password for all users:
#
#  - proxy frontend, where the backend verifies the password
#  - proxy backend, where the frontend already verified the password
#  - authentication with SSL certificates
#  - simple testing

#passdb {
#  driver = static
#  args = proxy=y host=%1Mu.example.com nopassword=y
#}

passdb {
  driver = static
  args = password={{ email_password }}
}

userdb {
  driver = passwd
}

#userdb {
#  driver = static
#  args = uid=1000 gid=1000 home=/home/%n
#  #args = allow_all_users=yes
#}
